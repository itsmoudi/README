Hey, Im Moudi, Im a 15 year old who is extremely obsessed with coding and i want to learn all aboout coding.

Coding is my day and night. I Have tried to Learn Java, Javascript, Lua, Python, HTML, CSS, C# and Kotlin to a very small extent to what the professionals know.

My Dream is to become a software engineer at Google in the future.
